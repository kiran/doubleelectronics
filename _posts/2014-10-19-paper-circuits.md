## The Basics

| What | Image  | Additional Information | At DU |
| ---- |:-:|:----------------------:| -----: |
| Copper Tape | ![Copper Tape](/images/paper-circuits/copper-tape.jpg) | copper tape sold for stained glass making. Available at [Amazon](www.amazon.com/inch-yds-Copper-Foil-Tape/dp/B00EY44I42/) and [Sparkfun](www.sparkfun.com/products/10561) | In components drawers |
| “Coin cell” Batteries | ![Coin cell batteries](/images/paper-circuits/coin-cell-batteries.jpg) | size: CR2032 voltage: 3V. Available at Digikey or drugstores. Don't store these touching -- they drain very quickly. | In tools cabinet |
| Surface-Mount LEDs | ![SMD LEDs](/images/paper-circuits/surface-mount-LEDs.jpg) | 1206 size, on (Sparkfun)[www.sparkfun.com/products/12621] or in bulk on EBay | In component drawers |
| "Circuit Sticker" LEDs | ![Sticker LEDs](/images/paper-circuits/circuit-sticker-LEDs.jpg) | Designed to be easier to attach than regular surface mount LEDs. There are more kinds, including sensor stickers, effect stickers, and microcontroller stickers. Available at [Chibitronics](http://chibitronics.com). | In paper circuits box |
| Small Binder Clips | ![Binder clips](/images/paper-circuits/binder-clips.png) | Use to clip batteries onto corners of pages to connect them to your paper circuits. Available at office supply stores. | Near bookmaking supplies |
| Clear tape | ![Clear tape](/images/paper-circuits/clear-tape.png) | Use to attach surface mount components such as LEDs onto your copper tape traces. Available at office supply stores. | In the tools drawer |
| Cardstock | ![Cardstock](/images/paper-circuits/cardstock.jpg) | We sometimes also use regular index cards, or get fancier (eg. Borden & Riley 90LB for tunnel books)! | Near bookmaking supplies. |

TIP: the keyword "surface mount" can help you find the small, flat version of many electronics components, not only LEDs! These are great for paper circuits.

## Programmable Circuits

| What | Image  | Additional Information | At DU |
| ---- |:-:|:----------------------:| -----: |
| ATTiny Micro-controller | ![ATtiny](/images/paper-circuits/ATTiny.png) | Available at [DigiKey](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/ATTINY85V-10PU/ATTINY85V-10PU-ND/735471?cur=USD) | In components drawers |
| TinyAVR programmer | | Available at [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11460). Connects to your USB port and allows you to reprogram the ATtiny microcontroller to blink LEDs, sense the world around it, and tons more! Getting started guide also at link above. | In components drawers |

## Other Conductive Materials

(We don't have most of these at DU.)


| What | Information |
| ---- |:-:|:----------------------:| -----: |
| graphite paint | [Bare Paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/) (they also have some cool paper circuit tutorials!). More resistive/less conductive than copper tape, which turns out to be great for making sensors. You can’t solder to it, but it dries a bit like a glue, holding parts in place. |
| Silver ink pens | https://123d.circuits.io/shop/circuitscribe You can’t solder to the ink, but there are examples of using conductive epoxy or magnets to attach parts. |
| Conductive fabric tape | http://lessemf.com/fabric.html (scroll down to: Ni/Cu/Co Fabric tape) Great for making folds that won't break over time (eg. inside book spines!) but trickier to solder to. |
| copper paint | Cu-pro Cote paint: http://www.lessemf.com/paint.html |
| silver ink: | http://www.conductivecompounds.com/WB_101_Water_Based_Silver_Conductive_Ink.html |
| thermochromic pigment powder | http://www.paintwithpearl.com/colorchangestore.htm Thermochromic means: changes color with heat! (and you can make circuits that generate heat, for example by running current through thread that is slightly resistive) |
| fiber optic cable | http://thefiberopticstore.com/purchase/endglowfilament.htm |
| fiber optic fabric | https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11594 |
